# Railway Deployment Fix

## ðŸ”§ Simple Fix Option

If the build is still failing, try this simpler approach:

### Update package.json scripts to:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsx server/index.ts",
    "build": "echo 'No build needed'"
  }
}
```

### Or use this even simpler Railway configuration:

Create `Procfile` in your root directory:
```
web: npx tsx server/index.ts
```

## ðŸš€ Alternative Deployment Platform

If Railway continues to fail, try **Render.com**:

1. Go to render.com
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npx tsx server/index.ts`
4. Deploy!

## âš¡ Quick Test Commands

Test locally first:
```bash
npm install
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

The server should start on port 3000.
